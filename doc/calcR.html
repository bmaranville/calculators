  <h3 class="ui-widget-header">Loading data:</h3>
    The loader is expecting tab or space-delimited columnar data files, with the columns in the order
    <b>Q</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>dR</b> ... (more columns are permitted but ignored).  The <b>dR</b> should be 
    a 1-sigma error bar on the reflectivity.  Header lines prepended with # will be ignored.  For polarized
    data, a single file with the desired cross-sections concatenated with two carriage returns between them (\n\n)
    is expected, where the polarization is indicated in a header line before the data in each section as e.g.
    (this is the format exported by the NCNR online reduction system)
    <pre># "polarization": "++"
0.01 0.99 0.01
...</pre>
   
  <h3 class="ui-widget-header">Calculations</h3>
    The reflectivity is calculated using a slab model with Nevot-Croce roughness as in ref. [1]<br>
    The magnetic calculations including Zeeman effects are described in [2].
    
  
  
  <h3 class="ui-widget-header">Export to Refl1D</h3>
    In order to get a full fit including instrumental resolution, parameter correlation estimates and true statistial
    error bars on the model, the model prepared here can be exported to the powerful 
    <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/reflpak/">Refl1D</a> program by simply pushing the "generate script..." button.
    This script can be directly imported to <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/reflpak/">Refl1D</a>, 
    and includes a reference to any data files loaded.
